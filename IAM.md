# Identity and Access Management and Security on AWS

## Authentication

### Managing users and their access

Create and manage users and their security such as access keys, passwords and multifactor authentication.

### managing deferated users and their access

Using IAM, you can manage federated users.
Using federation, you can use single sign-on (SSO) to access the AWS resources using the credentials of your corporate directory.

Your external users sign in through a well-known identity provider such as Google, Amazon or Facebook. You can give those external identities permissions to use AWS resources in your account.
